# MediQueue - Project Summary

## Project Overview

MediQueue is an innovative hospital queue management system that leverages artificial intelligence to predict wait times and optimize patient flow. The platform provides accurate wait time estimations based on various factors including queue length, urgency level, hospital capacity, time of day, and more.

## Key Components Implemented

### AI Wait Time Predictor

Located in `lib/ai/waitTimePredictor.ts`, this core module:
- Defines the urgency level enum (EMERGENCY, HIGH, NORMAL, LOW)
- Provides interfaces for queue data and prediction results
- Implements a sophisticated algorithm that considers multiple factors:
  - Patient count and queue position
  - Urgency level adjustments
  - Hospital load/capacity
  - Time-based factors (time of day, day of week, holidays)
  - Emergency cases and staffing levels
- Returns detailed predictions with confidence scores and ranges

### Queue Status Component

Located in `components/QueueStatus.tsx`, this React component:
- Displays a patient's current queue position
- Shows estimated wait time based on AI predictions
- Visually represents urgency level with appropriate colors
- Provides a range of possible wait times and confidence level
- Lists factors affecting the wait time calculation
- Includes appointment details when available
- Offers a refresh button for updated information

### API Routes

The API route in `app/api/predictions/route.ts`:
- Handles POST requests to generate wait time predictions
- Validates incoming data
- Prepares queue data for the predictor
- Adjusts predictions based on queue position
- Provides a GET endpoint for model information

### Home Page and Layout

- The home page introduces the system and links to key areas
- The app layout provides consistent navigation and footer

## Technical Implementation

### UI/UX

- Clean, responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Color-coded urgency levels for intuitive understanding
- Loading states and error handling
- Interactive elements for exploring prediction details

### Data Flow

1. User/system provides queue data (hospital, department, urgency level, etc.)
2. API endpoint processes the request and sends to predictor
3. AI predictor calculates estimated wait time and confidence level
4. Results are displayed to the user with visual elements
5. Periodic refresh keeps information up-to-date

### Styling

- Consistent color scheme with CSS variables
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Custom animations for better user experience
- Reusable UI components and utility classes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Integration with Real Hospital Systems**: Connect with actual hospital management systems to access real-time data
2. **Machine Learning Model**: Replace the algorithmic predictor with a trained ML model using historical data
3. **Patient Notification System**: Push notifications for queue updates and approaching appointments
4. **Staff Dashboard**: Detailed analytics and queue management tools for hospital staff
5. **Multi-language Support**: Interface localization for diverse patient populations

## Conclusion

MediQueue demonstrates how artificial intelligence can improve healthcare experiences by providing accurate wait time predictions. The implemented components form a solid foundation for a fully-featured hospital queue management system that can significantly reduce patient frustration and improve hospital resource allocation.
